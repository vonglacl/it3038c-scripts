Description:

Once you run the code, the sentence "Please enter the countdown time in seconds" will show up in the results.

The user should then be able to type in any number of seconds, click enter, and then the countdown will begin from the chosen number of seconds, all the way down to the finish.

If the user inputs an invalid number, like a character, then the output for the user will be "Invalid. Please enter a valid number of seconds."
